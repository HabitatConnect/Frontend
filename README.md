# HabitatConnect Frontend

## Purpose
The frontend module is the user-facing interface of our project, designed to be engaging and intuitive. Its main purpose is to facilitate the creation of announcements and maintenance requests, provide real-time monitoring of washing machine statuses, and offer other interactive features. This module ensures a seamless user experience by presenting data fetched from the backend, with client-side validation for quick feedback. It connects to backend APIs to perform tasks such as creating, updating, and deleting announcements and maintenance requests. The interface is responsive and device-agnostic, featuring a component-based architecture for modular development and scalability. Specific visual components enhance the overall user experience, making interactions with announcements, calendars, maintenance requests, washing machine statuses, and profile settings dynamic and engaging.

## Functionality
The frontend functionality is built using a combination of technologies:

- HTML structures the content.
- CSS adds style and ensures a visually appealing design.
- JavaScript, along with the EJS templating engine, provides dynamic content updates and interactivity.
- Bootstrap CSS framework enhances responsiveness and simplifies design with pre-built components.
- AJAX is used for asynchronous data retrieval, ensuring a seamless and responsive user experience.
- Responsive design principles ensure compatibility across various devices, making it easy for users to interact with announcements, submit maintenance requests, and more.

## Location of Source Code
