# HabitatConnect Frontend

## Purpose
The frontend module is the user-facing interface of our project, designed to be engaging and intuitive. Its main purpose is to facilitate the creation of announcements and maintenance requests, provide real-time monitoring of washing machine statuses, and offer other interactive features. This module ensures a seamless user experience by presenting data fetched from the backend, with client-side validation for quick feedback. Specific visual components enhance the overall user experience, making interactions with announcements, calendars, maintenance requests, washing machine statuses, and profile settings dynamic and engaging.

## Functionality
The frontend functionality is built using a combination of technologies:

- HTML structures the content.
- CSS adds style and ensures a visually appealing design.
- JavaScript, along with the EJS templating engine, provides dynamic content updates and interactivity.
- Express.js is used to handle server-side logic.
- Bootstrap CSS framework enhances responsiveness and simplifies design with pre-built components.
- Responsive design principles ensure compatibility across various devices, making it easy for users to interact with announcements, submit maintenance requests, and more.
